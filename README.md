### Introduction
Hello! I am Alyssa, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of California, Irvine (UCI). My interests are strongly rooted in front-end development and machine learning.

When I'm not diving deep into code, you'll likely find me on a basketball court or golf course! After spending hours looking at a computer screen, these activities help me stay active and mentally refreshed. Besides this, I also love exploring new hobbies or skills. I find the process of learning very addicting.
